<h2>Professioal Experience</h2>
<p><b>University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, CA</b><br>
  <i>Graduate Research Assistant</i>; 8/2019-Present<br>
  Project: Using molecular and statistical tools to investigate the effects that environmental shifts have on the composition, metabolism, and biotic associations of marine protist communities</p>
 <p> - Published a statistical software package in R to carry out ecological network analyses with time-series species abundance data.<br>
  - Prepared metabarcoding libraries and used bioinformatic pipelines to create 16S and 18S amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and operational taxonomic units (OTUs).<br>
  - Created and visualized ecological networks of microbes using time-series metabarcoding data.<br>
  - Extracted and purified RNA from seawater for metatranscriptomic library preparation and sequencing.<br>
  - Bioinformatically processed, analyzed, and visualized metatranscriptomic datasets using bash (Unix shell), R, and python.</p>

<p><b>Horn Point Laboratory, Cambridge, MD</b><br>
  <i>Graduate Research Assistant</i>; 8/2017-8/2019<br>
Project: Prevalence, succession and potential for recovery of diatom communities in the Anacostia River, Chesapeake Bay</p>
<p>- Conducted nitrate reductase enzyme analyses to determine rates of nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton.<br>
  - Used pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry to quantify phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency.<br>
  - Used flow cytometry and light microscopy to quantify phytoplankton abundances in field samples.<br>
  - Cultured phytoplankton using batch culture techniques.<br>
  - Worked closely with NOAA Sea Grant (governmental organization) and Riverkeeper (non-governmental organization) to
assess the effectiveness of a newly-implemented sewage and stormwater management system in reducing pollution in the Anacostia River, Washington D.C.</p>
