<p>My journey into marine microbial ecology began when I was an undergraduate biology student at Lafayette College (Easton, PA). At Lafayette, I had the opportunity to participate in a monthly water quality/phytoplankton monitoring project on the Hudson-Raritan estuary under the guidance of Dr. Megan Rothenberger. This project captured my interest as an undergraduate and inspired me to continue my education in marine microbial ecology as a graduate student. In 2019, I completed my M.S. degree in Marine Science from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Horn Point Lab (Cambridge, MD). My M.S. thesis project focused on how a newly implemented sewage and stormwater management system (The Anacostia River Tunnel Project) altered nutrient levels and phytoplankton community composition in the eutrophic, Anacostia River (Washington, D.C.). I carried out this work with support I received as a Maryland Sea Grant Fellow and worked under the guidance of Dr. Pat Glibert.</p> 

<p>During my time as a M.S. student, I became increasingly interested in the ways in which scientists were using omics data to study microbial community composition and function. My growing interest in the use of these "big data" techniques prompted me to search for a Ph.D. project that would allow me to use omics methods to study oceanic microbial communities. I started my Ph.D. in 2019 in the Marine and Environmental Biology program at the University of Southern California. Under the guidance of Dr. David Caron, I have used metatranscriptomic, tag-sequencing, and network analysis approaches to study microbial community dynamics at two time-series stations: Station ALOHA (a long-term oligotrophic habitat asssessment) and SPOT (San Pedro Ocean Time-series).</p> 

<p>My work as a Ph.D. student has opened my eyes to the power of using omics methods and statistical approaches to study oceanic microbes, and how new technologies may increase our understanding of marine microbial community dynamics in the future. Additionally, my work as a Ph.D. student has made me incredibly passionate about teaching the next generation of biologists applied statistics and computing. I believe that  undergraduate biology students and early-career graduate students should be encouraged to learn basic computer science and applied statistics, given the importance of these tools when working with "big" biological datasets. I hope to become a professor in the future so that I can have the privilege of mentoring and guiding the next generation of scientists and environmental advocates.</p>
